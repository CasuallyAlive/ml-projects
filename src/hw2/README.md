# HW2 Submission
## Description
Homework 2 submission for ML. The report/ directory contains the first 3 questions of my written report and the ./data contains the directory for the data files. I drafted a jupyter notebook to run and organize my experiments. The file can be found here [jupyter notebook](./hw2_exp_report.ipynb) that I used to make the [report](./hw2_exp_report.pdf) and run the experiments. I used the cade machine's conda 'base' environment to run all my experiments. Please make sure to select the base environment as your jupyter kernel to run my implementation and the necessary experiments. My perceptron implementation can be found [here](./perceptron.py). Please make sure to keep my [utils](./utils.py) file in the same folder since it contains multiple functions that I used and implemented in the project.
