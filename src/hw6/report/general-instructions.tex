\section*{General Instructions}

{\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
  \item You are welcome to talk to other members of the class about the
    homework. I am more concerned that you understand the underlying
    concepts. However, you should write down your own solution. Please keep the
    class collaboration policy in mind.

  \item Feel free discuss the homework with the instructor or the TAs.

  \item Your written solutions should be brief and clear. You need to show your
    work, not just the final answer, but you do \emph{not} need to write it in
    gory detail. Your assignment should be {\bf no more than 10 pages}. Every
    extra page will cost a point.

  \item Handwritten solutions or photos of handwritten solutions will not be accepted. 


  \item The homework is due by midnight of the due date. Please submit the
    homework on Canvas. You should upload two files: a report with answers to
    the questions below, and a compressed file (\texttt{.zip} or
    \texttt{.tar.gz}) containing your code.

  \end{itemize}
  \paragraph{Important} Do not just put down an answer. We want 
  explanations of your answers. No points will be given for just the final answer
  without an explanation.
